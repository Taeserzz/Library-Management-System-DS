#  üìöLibrary Management System

### University of Technology, Jamiaca - Data Structures Project (20%) 

This project is a **Library Management System** that efficiently manages books, patrons, and check-in/check-out operations using **linked lists, stacks, queuess, and binary search trees (BSTs)**.

---

## üìå **Project Overview**
This system provides the following functionalities: 
- **Book Management:** Add, remove, and search books (BST for effficient searching).
- **Patron Management:** Register patrons, track checkouts (linked list).
- **Check-In/Check-Out System:** Handle borrowing/returning (queue for checkouts, stack for undo).
- **Search Functionality:** Find books by **title, author, or ISBN** (BST implementation).
- **User Interface:** CLI/GUI for user interactions.
- **File System:** Persistent storage for **books, patrons, and passwords**.
- **Password Management:** Default admin login, password hashing, secure authentication.

## üõ† **Tech Stack** 
- **Programming Language:** Java 
- **Data Structures Used:** Linked List, Stack, Queue, Binary Search Tree (BST)
- **File Storage:** Text files for book and patron management
- **Authentication:** Password hashing for security
